<p>The Mystery Hunt is an MIT event and is best experienced in person
at the Institute. For those who are coming from out of town, we have

appears to be full, please <a href="./contact.html">get in touch with
us</a> and we will work with the hotel on your behalf. (Per our
contracts with the hotels, requests for additional rooms need to be
submitted through us.)</p>

<p>We are very pleased to announce the <i>33rd Annual
  Conference on Maturing Young Scientific Theories: Emerging
  Resolutions for Yielding Heuristic Unphysics using Noncomputation
  Techniques.</i>  The website for the conference is at <a
  href="http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/heuristic/">http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/heuristic/</a>
  and the poster can be found <a href="poster.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>New modes of thinking and doing are needed to adapt to the
complexities of modern life. Nowadays research is pushing forward,
looking for complex, heterogeneous models for intractable problems.
By bringing together the theoretical frameworks of Heuristic Unphysics
with the engineering models of Noncomputation Techniques, we can truly
begin to look for the Conditional Operator on Interdimensional
Nature.</p>

<p>We have an exciting program planned out for attendees, including a
plenary lecture:</p>

Friday January 17th, 2014<br />
Kresge Auditorium, MIT<br />

<b>ABSTRACT:</b><br />
Contemporary accounts of unexplained phenomena are grounded in<br />
ontological constructions that fail to recognize the ways enigmas fail to<br />
match our preconceptions.  Indeed, the search for explanation through<br />
epistemological games will not yield a resolution.  The fundamental <br />
theories underlying our understanding of these clues must yield to <br />
other, more objective modes of understanding reality. In order to explain<br />
these puzzling happenings, we turn to the emerging study of so-called<br />
heuristic unphysics, which begins with the Axiom of the Atlasphere: <br />
Existence is Identity, Consciousness is Identification.  From this, a <br />
holistic understanding of the interplay between meta-structures and<br />
unsolvable mysteries will lead to an exciting chase through modern <br />
noncomputation techniques. From these tools we will uncover underlying<br />
truths regarding the nature and location of hidden treasures.<br />
</p>

<p>We are sure that your participation will make this a stellar event.
Looking forward to seeing you on January 17th!</p>

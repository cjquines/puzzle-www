<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<p><b>Should I still come to MIT’s campus for the hunt?</b><br>No. MIT’s campus might be closed, and there will be nothing in the hunt that requires or encourages the presence of solvers on campus. We discourage gathering for this hunt anywhere with meaningful numbers of COVID-19 cases. You will be able to enjoy the hunt in the same way from any location with internet access.</p>
<p><b>Should my team plan to gather on our own to solve puzzles?</b><br>We do not recommend doing this. Please keep your own health and safety, and any legal and medical guidelines in place where you live, foremost in your mind. Our intention is that no one's solving experience will be hurt by staying safely distanced.</p>
<p><b>Will you have tips to help our team with online collaboration?</b><br>Yes! Stay tuned for more about this in the coming months.</p>
<p><b>Will the winner still make next year’s Mystery Hunt?</b><br>Yes, the winning team will be tasked with creating the 2022 MIT Mystery Hunt, which should once again take place in person on MIT’s campus, assuming the state of the world allows for it.</p>
<p><b>Will there be any differences in the size or scope of this hunt?</b><br>No. We expect this Mystery Hunt to be commensurate in size with recent Mystery Hunts.</p>
<p><b>What about the coin?</b><br>As always, the first team to find the coin will be the winner.</p>
<p><b>Are there any team size restrictions?</b><br>No, you may register teams of any size. Similar to recent hunts, we believe teams with many more than 75 people may have less fun.</p>
<p>Mystery Hunt has a very large scope, but we're working to make it an amazing experience for both small and large teams.</p>
<p><b>Is this event still related to MIT?</b><br>Yes! This is still the MIT Mystery Hunt, organized through MIT Puzzle Club, and it will feature plenty of MIT-specific content. MIT familiarity will help you succeed in the hunt, and MIT students are especially encouraged to participate!</p>
<p><b>Is this FAQ a puzzle?</b><br>No.</p>
